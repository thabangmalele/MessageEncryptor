# 🔐 Message Encryptor

A stylish, lightweight terminal-based message encryption and decryption tool written in C#.  
This app uses a basic Caesar cipher to encrypt your messages, saves them with timestamps, and lets you decrypt and view them later — all in a vibrant, color-coded console interface.

## 💡 Features

- 🔒 Encrypt messages with a Caesar cipher (shift of +3)
- 🔓 Decrypt all saved messages with timestamp context
- 🕒 Automatically logs timestamps for every message
- 💾 Saves all messages to `messages.txt` (appended, not overwritten)
- 🌈 Color-coded console output for a clean, hacker-esque vibe
- 📋 Session history displayed when the app exits
- 🖥️ Fully console-based — easy to read and use
